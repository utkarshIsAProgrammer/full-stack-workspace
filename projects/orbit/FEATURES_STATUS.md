# Orbit — Feature Audit / Status Sheet (August 6, 2026)

> Verifies each feature claimed in `FEATURES.md` against the actual code.
> **✅ DONE** = implemented & wired end-to-end · **🟡 PARTIAL** = exists but limited/disabled · **❌ MISSING** = listed but not found in code.
> This sheet was produced by a mechanical code audit on 2026-08-06.

## Audit Method

- Server: all route files scanned (`server/src/routes/*.routes.ts`) and cross-checked against mounts in `server/src/server.ts`.
- Client: all components in `client/src/components/*.tsx` listed; deleted/unreferenced components confirmed absent.
- Feature-level checks: greps for specific handlers, hooks, and disabled states.

| group.routes | ✅ | `/api/chats/groups` |
| audioRoom.routes | ❌ **REMOVED** | No route file, not mounted, no client code (feature fully removed) |

**Result: 37 route modules mounted, 0 orphaned server route files.**

---

## 2. Components — Deleted / Unreferenced Check

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `AudioRooms.tsx` | ❌ deleted — zero references in client |
| `BackgroundGradients.tsx` | ❌ deleted — zero references |
| `LiquidEther.tsx` | ❌ deleted — zero references |
| `Reels.tsx` / `ReelsFeed` | ❌ never exists — no references |
| Old CI file, old baselines, old `sw.js` | ❌ removed |

**Result: catalog omits all of these (correct) — no dead imports remain.**

## 3. Feature-by-Feature Verification

### 🟢 Fully verified as implemented

| Feature | Evidence in code |
| --- | --- |
| Polls — one vote, locked after choice | `PollCard.tsx` — `const locked = readOnly \|\| expired \|\| hasVoted \|\| voting;` and "· Voted" label |
| Poll selected style (white + gold glow) | `PollCard.tsx` — amber/gold accents |
| Collaborator disabled | `PostModal.tsx` — "Collab toggle — DISABLED (feature temporarily unavailable)" |
| Glance editor (text + drawing) | `GlanceEditor.tsx` — `Tool = "draw" \| "text"`, draw color palette, scaled strokes |
| Glance 9:16 frame + zoom/pan (no free crop) | `GlanceEditor.tsx` — `GLANCE_ASPECT = 9/16`, `MAX_ZOOM = 4`, fit/center math |
| Glance audience (public / close friends) | `GlanceEditor.tsx` — `type GlanceVisibility = "public" \| "closeFriends"` |
| WhatsApp-style auto-grow inputs | `hooks/useAutoGrow.ts` — shared hook |
| Post images keep natural aspect (no crop box) | `PostModal.tsx` — "No forced crop box — images keep their natural aspect ratio" |
| View tracking (3s in view) | `hooks/usePostViewTracking.ts` — module-scope dedup set |
| Debounced user/message search | `Chat.tsx` — `userSearchTimerRef` (300ms) + `userSearchSeqRef` |
| Mute conversation (list + three-dot) | `Chat.tsx` — `handleToggleConvMute` + menu item + `selectedConv` sync |
| Image optimization (Cloudinary thumbs) | `utils/imageUrls.ts` + `UserAvatar` size prop |
| Offline store + sync queue | `utils/offlineDB.ts`, `utils/syncQueue.ts`, `hooks/useOfflineSync.ts` |
| Cache warm/evict/refresh | `utils/api.ts` — `warmCache`, `clearAllCaches`, `stopCacheRefreshTimer` |
| Emoji reactions (toggle, latest first) | `EmojiReactionMenu.tsx` used in Chat/Communities/CommentNode |
| Blocked-user enforcement (chat) | `Chat.tsx` — `blockedPartner` check, `blockToggling` |
| Community mute / leave long-press | `Communities.tsx` (long-press list menu) |
| Community voice notes identical to chat | `Communities.tsx` voice-note state/handlers |
| 37 client tests passing | vitest run |

### 🟡 Partial / limited by design

| Feature | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Invite Collaborator | Backend + UI present but **button disabled** per user request — no one can use it yet |
| Audio Rooms | Fully removed (server + client) — documented in catalog as not present |
| Light mode / theme switching | Removed — app is dark-only by design |

### ✅ Confirmed absent (correctly not in catalog)

| Feature | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Reels | No backend route, no client component |
| Free crop on glances | Removed; editor uses zoom/pan |
| Background gradients / Liquid Ether canvas | Removed for performance |

---

## 4. Summary

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Server route modules mounted | **37** |
| Orphaned server route files | **0** |
| Client components | **80+** |

_This status sheet is auto-maintained alongside `FEATURES.md`. Re-run the audit greps after any feature change to keep both in sync._
